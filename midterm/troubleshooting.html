            <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
            
            <p>If you are experiencing any issues, I may have a few suggestions to assist. I am no expert but I'll do my best.</p>
            
            <p>The biggest issues seem to arise with the Metra ASWC-1 and factory steering wheel controls. While it is advertised as auto-programming, it may not always do that. <a href="https://metradealer.com/files/aswc/ASWC-1_INST_957.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a> is a link to the wiring troubleshooting guide for the device. It assisted me quite a bit when learning how to program the device for my mute button.</p>
            
            <p>If you are experiencing issues with your head unit unrelated to steering wheel controls, verify you correctly wired all colors together from each harness. If this is correct, you may need to contact the manufacturer for further assistance.</p>
