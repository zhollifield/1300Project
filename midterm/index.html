            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello, I will be going over a brief explanation of how to upgrade the radio in your 2010-2014 Subaru Outback.</p>
            <p>I found it difficult to find the information consolidated down to one place. After my experience, I found that it is not a terrible task as long as you have all the information at hand. Important information like wiring harness pinouts for the head unit are hard to find online so I will be providing those as well. This guide will allow you to retain your stock steering wheel controls with your aftermarket head unit, something most guides do not cover.</p>
