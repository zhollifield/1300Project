        <h4>Putting It All Together</h4>
        
        <p>Once you have the parts required, we will begin assembling. The first step is to install the CPU into the motherboard. This installation procedure can be different due to your CPU manufacturer so please refer to your manual. The next step is to install the cooler onto the motherboard and CPU. This will vary depending on the cooler you choose, but should be fairly straight forward. Once the cooler is installed, proceed to install the RAM into the slots on your motherboard. After this is done, install the assembled motherboard into your case. Then, you will install the power supply into the case as well, and connect the required power cables. Lastly, install your GPU into the indicated slot on your motherboard.  </p>
        
        <p>Now that your computer is assembled, your going to want to install the operating system of your choice. There are a few different options available and you can feel free to choose any that you need. After OS insstallation, you are now ready to use your new computer. Install all your new games, favorite internet browser, or even a virus or two. (Just kidding don't do that)</p>
